-- views.sql
-- LogStream Analytics Views
-- Purpose : Pre-built Postgres views for Metabase dashboards.
--           Each view maps directly to a Metabase panel.
--           All views read from the log_entries partitioned table.
--
-- Usage   : Run once against your database to create all views.
--           Metabase connects and queries them like normal tables.
--           Re-run with CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW to update any view.
--
-- Indexes used:
--   idx_logs_search_lookup  → (service_name, level, timestamp DESC)
--   idx_logs_volume_brin    → BRIN on timestamp
